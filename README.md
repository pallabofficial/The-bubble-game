## Description



## My Learnings
â€¢	<strong>align-content:</strong> The align-content property in CSS is used within a flex container to align the lines of flex items when there is extra space in the cross-axis (the perpendicular axis to the main axis). It applies when the flex container has multiple lines of flex items created by flex-wrap: wrap;.<br>
â€¢	DOM Rect object<br>
â€¢	target property of event<br>
â€¢	innerText vs innerHTML vs textContent<br>
â€¢	clearInterval()<br>
â€¢	6<br>
â€¢	7<br>


## Scope of Improvement
â€¢	the target is just a random number between 1 and 10, what if the target doesn't match any number in the bubble?<br>
â€¢	only generate that much of bubble which fits the screen width<br>
